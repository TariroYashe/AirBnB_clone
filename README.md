AirBnB clone - The console

1. The Console
Create a console that allows users to create, update, destroy, and show instances of your classes (data objects). This will be useful for development and debugging.

2. Command Interpreter (Shell):
Create a command-line interface (CLI) for interacting with your application.
Implement basic commands for manipulating data, such as listing, creating, updating, and deleting listings.
Use a programming language like Python to build the command interpreter.
